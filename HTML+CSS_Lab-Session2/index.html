        <p>One of the most interesting characters in the Mahabharata is Karna, also called Surya Putra. Despite coming from a lowly background, he overcame the stigma associated with his birth to become one of the greatest warriors of his era. He was born to the sun god Surya. I respect Karna for his unparalleled bravery, devotion, and kindness. Throughout his life, he experienced injustice and rejection, but he never allowed resentment to overshadow his sense of honour or responsibility. His life serves as a potent reminder that greatness is determined by one's decisions rather than one's background.</p>
